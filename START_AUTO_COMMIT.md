# 🚀 Quick Start: Auto-Commit Script

## Start Monitoring (One Command)

```bash
./auto-commit.sh
```

That's it! The script will now:
- ✅ Check for changes every 2 seconds
- ✅ Auto-commit with timestamp
- ✅ Auto-push to GitHub

## Stop Monitoring

Press: `Ctrl + C` (or `Cmd + C` on Mac)

## What You'll See

```
🚀 MoneyWise Auto-Commit Script Started
📁 Monitoring directory: /Users/soumya/moneywise
⏰ Checking every 2 seconds...
Press Ctrl+C to stop

✅ [2024-01-15 10:30:45] Commit #1: Changes committed and pushed
✅ [2024-01-15 10:31:02] Commit #2: Changes committed and pushed
```

## Example Workflow

```bash
# 1. Start the script
./auto-commit.sh

# 2. Open another terminal and make changes
# Edit files, add features, etc.

# 3. Script automatically commits everything

# 4. Stop when done
# Press Ctrl+C
```
