**Income** = Money you get (salary, business, etc.)
**Expense** = Money you spend (rent, food, shopping)
**Saving** = Money you keep aside

Example: Raj earns ₹25,000/month in Jaipur.
- Rent: ₹8,000
- Food: ₹5,000
- Transport: ₹2,000
- Bills: ₹3,000
Total spent = ₹18,000
Savings = ₹7,000

- Food, rent, medicines, transport

**Wants** = Nice to have, but not urgent
- New phone, eating out, branded clothes

Example: Priya wants a new phone for ₹30,000.
Her current phone works fine.
This is a WANT, not a NEED.

How much? 
- Minimum: 3 months of expenses
- Better: 6 months of expenses

Example: Your monthly expense = ₹20,000
Emergency fund = ₹20,000 × 6 = ₹1,20,000

Keep it in a savings account or liquid fund.

Example: Income = ₹30,000

2. Automate savings (auto-transfer to another account)
3. Track every expense for 1 month
4. Cut one unnecessary expense

Example: Ankit stopped buying coffee daily (₹100/day)
Saved: ₹3,000/month = ₹36,000/year!

- No one guarantees returns
- Banks never ask for OTP/PIN
- If it sounds too good, it's a scam
- Research before investing anywhere

- Saving: Keep money safe (bank account)
- Investing: Put money to work (stocks, mutual funds)

**Why invest?**
Inflation eats your money!
₹100 today ≠ ₹100 after 10 years

Example: ₹1,00,000 in savings account (4% interest)
After 10 years = ₹1,48,000

Same money in good mutual fund (12% average)
After 10 years = ₹3,10,000

Big difference!

- Very High Risk: Crypto (can be 100x or zero)

Never invest money you need in next 2-3 years.
Never invest borrowed money.
Never invest emergency fund.

Price goes down, you panic and sell = Loss

**Important:**
Stock prices go up and down daily. That's normal!

- Diversified (money in many stocks)
- Can start with just ₹500/month
- Less risky than buying individual stocks

**Types:**
- Equity funds (stocks) - Higher risk, higher return
- Debt funds (bonds) - Lower risk, stable return
- Hybrid funds (mix) - Balanced`,

Coin crashed. He lost everything.

**Golden Rules:**
- Only invest 2-5% of savings in crypto (if at all)
- Never invest borrowed money
- Never believe "guaranteed returns"
- Research for months before investing
