    story: `**Rahul's Story - Age 24, Indore**

Rahul worked at a call center earning ₹22,000/month. He had saved ₹80,000 over 2 years.

One day, his friend showed him a WhatsApp message:
"New crypto coin launching! Invest ₹10,000, get ₹1,00,000 in 2 months! Limited slots!"

Rahul saw YouTube videos of people showing "profits". Everyone was talking about it.

**FOMO kicked in.** (Fear Of Missing Out)

He invested ₹50,000 - more than half his savings!

**Week 1:** Price went up 20%! Rahul was excited.
**Week 2:** Price went up 50%! He told all his friends.
**Week 3:** Price crashed 80%. Website disappeared.

Rahul lost ₹40,000. The "coin" was a scam.`,

Priya paid ₹10,000.

Amit invested ₹1,00,000 in good stocks (TCS, Infosys, HDFC Bank).

He was investing for long-term (5+ years).

**March 2020 - COVID crash:**
Market fell 30% in 1 month!

Amit's ₹1,00,000 became ₹70,000.

He panicked. He thought:
"I'll lose everything! Let me sell now!"

He sold everything at ₹70,000. Loss: ₹30,000.

**What happened after:**
- Market recovered in 6 months
- His stocks went up 80% from his buying price
- If he had held, ₹1,00,000 would be ₹1,80,000

Instead, he lost ₹30,000 and missed ₹80,000 gain.`,

Neha got her first credit card. Limit: ₹50,000.

She thought: "I can buy now, pay later!"

**Month 1:** Bought phone for ₹30,000. "I'll pay next month."
**Month 2:** Paid only minimum (₹1,500). Bought clothes for ₹10,000.

Interest rate: 3% per month = 36% per year!

Arjun earned ₹35,000/month. He invested ₹10,000/month in stocks and mutual funds.

He was doing great! Portfolio grew to ₹2,50,000 in 2 years.

But he had ZERO emergency fund. He thought:
"Why keep money idle in savings? I'll invest everything!"

**Then disaster struck:**
- His father had medical emergency
- Hospital needed ₹1,50,000 immediately
- He had only ₹8,000 in savings
